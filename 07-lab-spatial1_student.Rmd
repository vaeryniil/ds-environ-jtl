**Lab part 1: reading in fire raster data and plotting**

We will be working with the soil burn severity data from the 2020 Holiday Farm Fire (up the McKenzie E of Eugene), the 2020 Beachie Fire (near Portland) and the 2018 Terwilliger fire (up the McKenzie E of Eugene, near Cougar hotsprings). 

We will use data downloaded from the USGS:
https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/products/baer

Specifically, BARC Fire Severity layers are created by first calculating spectral indices from pre- and post-fire satellite imagery that are sensitive to changes caused by fire.  The two images are then subtracted showing the difference between them which is then binned into 4 burn severity classes (high, moderate, low, very low/unburned). Field crews ground-truth the severity classes.

The metadata files provide additional details on how the continuous data was binned into discrete catagories. 

- 1a. Read in each fire severity rasters, name them [fire name]_rast. The .tif files are the rasters.

HINT: The files are nested within folders so be aware of your file paths.

```{r loading rasters}
holiday_rast <- rast("./data/soil-burn-severity/2020_holidayfarm_sbs/HolidayFarm_SBS_final.tif")
terwilliger_rast <- rast("./data/soil-burn-severity/2018_terwilliger_sbs/SoilSeverity.tif")
beachie_rast <- rast("./data/soil-burn-severity/2020_beachiecreek_sbs/BeachieCreek_SBS_final.tif")

```

- 1b. Summarize the values of the rasters. Take note of the labels associated with the data values because you will need it for plotting.

```{r summary values}
summary(values(holiday_rast))
summary(values(terwilliger_rast))
summary(values(beachie_rast))
```

- 1c. Plot each raster.. Set the scale to be  `scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1)`

HINT: Remember we have to turn them into "data.frames" for ggplot to recognize them as plot-able. 

HINT HINT: Remember to check the labels of the data values to be able to set the fill.


```{r, fig.cap="Holiday plot with ggplot2 using the Spectral color scale"}
holiday_df <- as.data.frame(holiday_rast,xy=TRUE)
holiday_df$Layer_1 <- as.factor(holiday_df$Layer_1)
#str(holiday_df)
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = holiday_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1)

```

```{r,fig.cap="Beachie plot with ggplot2 using the Spectral color scale"}

beachie_rast_df <- as.data.frame(beachie_rast,xy=TRUE)
beachie_rast_df$Layer_1 <- as.factor(beachie_rast_df$Layer_1)
#str(beachie_df)
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = beachie_rast_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1)
```

```{r, fig.cap="Terwilliger plot with ggplot2 using the Spectral color scale"}

terwilliger_df <- as.data.frame(terwilliger_rast,xy=TRUE)
#str(terwilliger_df)
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data=terwilliger_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = SoilBurnSe)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1)

```

- 1d. Compare these visualizations what is something you notice?
-ANSWER: I notice that the Terwilliger fire data has its fire intensities labeled by descripitors (Unburned, etc.) while the other two have them labeled with numbers from 1 to 4 (excluding the very high number that was used to differentiate the border of the fires).

**Lab part 2: Exploring the attributes of our spatial data.**

- 2a. What are the crs of the rasters? What are the units? Are they all the same? 

```{r}
#holiday_rast
#crs(holiday_rast, proj = TRUE)
#beachie_rast
#crs(beachie_rast,proj=TRUE)
terwilliger_rast
crs(terwilliger_rast,proj=TRUE)
```

- ANSWER crs: Holiday: NAD83 / UTM zone 10N (EPSG:26910)  Beachie: IMAGINE GeoTIFF Support Terwilliger: NAD83 / USFS R6 Albers
- ANSWER units: Holiday: meters Beachie: meters Terwilliger: meters
- ANSWER the same? The coordinate reference systems of the three are all different.
          The same? The units of the three are all the same.

- 2b. What about the resolution of each raster?

```{r, resolution}
holiday_rast
beachie_rast
terwilliger_rast
```

- ANSWER resolution: Holiday: 20,20 Beachie: 20,20 Terwilliger: 30,30
- ANSWER the same? : The Holiday and Beachiecreek fire maps have the same resolution, but the Terwilliger map has a coarser resolution (30 in both x and y directions vs. 20).

- 2c. Calculate the min and max values of each raster. Are they all the same?

```{r, minmax}
minmax(holiday_rast)
minmax(beachie_rast)
minmax(terwilliger_rast)
```
- ANSWER minmax: Holiday: Min is 1, Max is 127 Beachie:Min is 1, Max is 127 Terwilliger:Min is 1, Max is 4.
- ANSWER the same? : They are not technically the same, because the Holiday and Beachie maps include a high value (127) to denote areas outside the burn. However, excluding this, they all have raster values between 1 and 4 (as seen in the plot legends) that denote burn intensity in that area.

Given we expect there to be 4 values for each bin of severity (high, moderate, low, very low/unburned), let's try to work out why there are values other than 1-4. After checking the metadata .txt and inspecting the metadata in the raster itself, I could not find an explicit mention of the meaning on the non 1-4 data (maybe you can?). Not great practices USGS! :( But it is likely missing data. Let's convert the Holiday data greater than 4 to NA, just like we would a regular matrix of data.

Uncomment the below.
```{r}
holiday_rast[holiday_rast > 4] <- NA
summary(values(holiday_rast))
```
That's better :) 

- 2d. Do the same conversion for Beachie.
```{r}
beachie_rast[beachie_rast > 4] <- NA
summary(values(beachie_rast))
```

**Lab part 3: Reprojection**
From our exploration above, the rasters are not in the same projection, so we will need to re-project them if we are going to be able to plot them together. 

We can use the `project()` function to reproject a raster into a new CRS. The syntax is `project(RasterObject, crs)`

- 3a. First we will reproject our `beachie_rast` raster data to match the `holidat_rast` CRS. If the resolution is different, change it to match Holiday's resolution.

Don't change the name from beachie_rast.

```{r true 1}
beachie_rast <- project(beachie_rast,
                                 crs(holiday_rast))

# This should return TRUE
crs(beachie_rast, proj = TRUE) == crs(holiday_rast, proj = TRUE)
```

- 3b. Now convert the Terwilliger crs to the holiday crs. If the resolution is different, change it to match Holiday's resolution.

```{r true 2}

terwilliger_rast <- project(terwilliger_rast,
                                 crs(holiday_rast),res=20)

# This should return TRUE TRUE
crs(terwilliger_rast, proj = TRUE) == crs(holiday_rast, proj = TRUE)
res(terwilliger_rast)[2] == res(holiday_rast)[2]
```

- 3c. Now you can plot all of the fires on the same map!
HINT: Remember to re-make the dataframes.


```{r plot-projected-raster1}
#re-make holiday df
holiday_df <- as.data.frame(holiday_rast,xy=TRUE)
holiday_df$Layer_1 <- as.factor(holiday_df$Layer_1)

#re-make beachie df
beachie_rast_df <- as.data.frame(beachie_rast,xy=TRUE)
beachie_rast_df$Layer_1 <- as.factor(beachie_rast_df$Layer_1)

#re-make terwilliger df
terwilliger_df <- as.data.frame(terwilliger_rast,xy=TRUE)


ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = holiday_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  #geom_raster(data = beachie_rast_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  geom_raster(data=terwilliger_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = SoilBurnSe)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1)
```

Well that's annoying. It appears as though in 2018 the makers of these data decided to give 1,2,3,4 categorical names which are being interpreted as two different scales. If we look at the terwilliger_rast values we can see that in min max. 

```{r}
#terwilliger_rast$SoilBurnSe
```

- 3d. Let's deal with the the easy way and modify the dataframe. Convert High to 4, Moderate to 3, Low to 2, and Unburned to 1 using your data subsetting skills.

Somethings you will need to be careful of: 
- If you check the class of terwilliger_rast_df$SoilBurnSe it is a factor, which is a special class of data that are ordered categories with specific levels. R will not let you convert add a level. So first, convert the data to characters (using as.character()). 
- Now the data are characters, so you will not be able to add in numerics. So code the 1,2,3 as characters i.e., "1", "2"...
- We will eventually want the data to be factors again so it will match up with the other rasters. So lastly, convert the data to a factor (using as.factor()). 

```{r reassigning values}
terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe = as.character(terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe)
terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe[terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe == "Unburned"] <- "1"
terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe[terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe == "Low"] <- "2"
terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe[terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe == "Moderate"] <- "3"
terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe[terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe == "High"] <- "4"
terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe = as.factor(terwilliger_df$SoilBurnSe)
```

- 3e. Try plotting again. 

```{r plot-projected-raster2}

ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = holiday_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  #geom_raster(data = beachie_rast_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  geom_raster(data=terwilliger_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = SoilBurnSe)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1)
```
The scale bar make sense! It would be nice to have a baselayer map to see where is Oregon these fires are.

**Lab part 4: Adding in vector data**

I found a nice ecoregion map on the OR spatial data website. https://spatialdata.oregonexplorer.info/geoportal/details;id=3c7862c4ae664993ad1531907b1e413e

- 4a. Load the data into R, it is in the OR-ecoregions folder.

```{r oreco}
eco_vector <- st_read(
  "./data/OR-ecoregions/Ecoregions_OregonConservationStrategy.shp")
```
- 4b. Check the projection and re-project if needed. We did not cover this in the lecture demo, but for vector data, use st_transform()

```{r or-crs}

eco_vector <- st_transform(eco_vector,crs = st_crs(holiday_rast,proj=TRUE))
#eco_vector$Ecoregion
```


```{r projection test}
#test cell.
#Okay, why isn't this working? What are the projections now that I've done this work?
crs(terwilliger_rast,proj=TRUE)
crs(holiday_rast,proj=TRUE)
crs(eco_vector,proj=TRUE)
#Welp, there's the problem. Okay, fixed
```


- 4c. Plot all of the data together (the rasters and vector data). You can layer on geom_sf into ggplot with the other rasters just like you would add another raster. 

```{r plot-projected-raster-withmap}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data=eco_vector, aes(color = Ecoregion)) +
  geom_raster(data = holiday_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  #geom_raster(data = beachie_rast_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = Layer_1)) +
  geom_raster(data=terwilliger_df, aes(x=x,y=y,fill = SoilBurnSe)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1) 
  
```
We could get fancy and zoom into the correct region using extent, which we will cover next week. For now, this looks pretty good. 

**Lab part 5: Exploring patterns of fire severity**

- 5a. Create a barplot with the count of each fire severity category. 
- Use  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1) to get the bars to match the maps.
- Plot the proportion on the y. To do this, in geom_bar, include y = (..count..)/sum(..count..). EX: aes(x= Layer_1, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)

HINT: Rather annoyingly, you will need to convert the layer values to factors again to get fill to recognize them. EX: fill=as.factor(Layer_1)

```{r plot-hist}

ggplot(holiday_df, aes(x = Layer_1,fill=as.factor(Layer_1))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + #what does ..count... mean?
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Holiday Fire Burn Severity") +
  xlab("Soil Burn Severity") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  labs(fill='Soil Burn Severity')

```


```{r beachie hist broken}

#I don't know why the beachie_rast_df isn't behaving the way I want it to,
#but it won't plot, so I can't view the fire data in this way.
#ggplot(beachie_rast_df, aes(x = Layer_1,fill=as.factor(Layer_1))) +
  #geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + #what does ..count... mean?
  #scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1) +
  #ggtitle("Histogram of Beachie Creek Fire Burn Severity") +
  #xlab("Soil Burn Severity") +
  #ylab("Proportion") +
  #labs(fill='Soil Burn Severity')

```




```{r terwilliger hist}
#Terwilliger Fire Histogram
ggplot(terwilliger_df, aes(x = SoilBurnSe,fill=as.factor(SoilBurnSe))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + #what does ..count... mean?
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction=-1) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Terwilliger Fire Burn Severity") +
  xlab("Soil Burn Severity") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  labs(fill='Soil Burn Severity')

```

```



-5b. What do you notice about the frequency of different severity classes when you compare these barplots. How does this relate to the Haldofsky reading?
ANSWER:The freqency of severity classes is not the same between fires. In the Holiday Fire, the majority of the values are Moderate (3), while in the Terwilliger fire, the majority are Light (2). This relates to the reading in that the severity of soil burn can impact the ability of the forest to regenerate after a fire, especially when reburns occur, since seeds in the upper layer of soil are more likely to be destroyed the higher the soil burn intensity.

Also, if the legend label bothers you (as it does for me)
